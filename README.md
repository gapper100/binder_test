# VESTING Career Experience Morning Case - test

This repo contains the slides and notebooks used for the Morning Case at VESTING Career Experience 2019.

## Usage

### Binder

To run the Notebooks, simply click the 'Launch Binder' button above, and run the notebooks from there.

### Local

Simply clone the repo, install the requirements with `$ pip install -r requirements.txt`, and run `jupyter notebook`.

## Notes

Running the code in `sprint_3.ipynb` on the Binder servers is quite slow. I have therefore added a duplicate version of this Notebook on Google Colab for those who cannot run these files locally.
